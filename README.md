# Xmlrpc for Scala
This is a Scala library to talk to servers via [XML-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC), originally created to connect to my university servers. 
This implementation is compliant with the [specification](http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html).
# What is XML-RPC?
As said in the spec:
> XML-RPC is a Remote Procedure Calling protocol that works over the Internet. An XML-RPC message is an HTTP-POST request. The body of the request is in XML. A procedure executes on the server and the value it returns is also formatted in XML.



# What does this solve?
